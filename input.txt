The quiet street stretched along rows of shuttered shops, their faded signs hinting at busier days long past. A stray dog lay curled in the shade of a lamppost, its ears twitching at the faint rumble of traffic from a distant road. Overhead, tangled power lines cut across the pale afternoon sky, swaying slightly in the breeze. The air smelled faintly of dust and old paint, carrying with it a sense of stillness, as though time had slowed just for this forgotten corner of the city.
